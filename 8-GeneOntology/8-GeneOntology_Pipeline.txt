8.GENE ONTOLOGY ENRICHMENT
##########################


#To do the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses, we used the GO_MWU.R originally written by Mikhail Matz at UT Austin (https://github.com/z0on/GO_MWU)
#The input files need to be include all of the genes in the transcriptome (with the 0 and 1 designation for neutral/no SNP or outlier SNP)
#The code we used to accomplish this is found at the top of the GO_MWU_forgithub.R script.
#The GO_MWU_forgithub.R also contains the script used to conduct and plot the gene ontology enrichment analyses for the 2-population and 4-population host files.
