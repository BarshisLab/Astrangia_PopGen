6. FST AND AMOVA ANALYSES

#--------------------------------------- Download and install necessary programs

##GenoDive is a GUI-interface program that we used here to get pairwise differentiation (Fst) estimates for all population comparisons as well as analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) 

#Downloaded genodive from here: http://www.bentleydrummer.nl/software/software/GenoDive.html
 
#To do AMOVA analysis, click on 'Analysis' tab, then follow these steps:
	* Analysis --> AMOVA --> Advanced --> structure of allele nested within individual nested within population
	*Run with 999 permutations
	
#To do pairwise differentiation, or Fst, analyses, click on the 'Analysis' tab and then follow these steps:
    * Analysis --> Pairwise Differentiation --> Amova Fs/write statistics and p-values, calculate
    *Run with 999 permutations
    
    
#The output of these analyses are listed in the coral&sym_genodive_output.xlsx file included in the folder for step 6 of the pipeline
